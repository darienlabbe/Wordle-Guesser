# Wordle-Guesser
This project involves the popular game "Wordle" where the program guesses what the correct wordle guess is. The program works by using a starter word and with each guess it adds to command that searches through a dictionary of all possible words. The guesser then picks out a random word from the smaller available list, shortening until finally the right answer is gotten. The program averages at 4-4.5 guesses in order to guess correctly.
